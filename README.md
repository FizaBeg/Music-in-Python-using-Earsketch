# Music-in-Python-using-Earsketch
This is the project  "Compose and Program Music in Python using Earsketch" which I completed on Coursera platform. Here, I learned basic Python functions in order to create a basic music composition.
The steps which I folllowed during the project course was - 
* Create and set up an Earsketch account.
* Navigate the Earsketch user interface.
* Set up program script.
* Add comments to the program script.
* Create a function to call sound files.
* Create a function to call effects for sound files.
* Organize code by using variables.

Here the link of the file is present in the 'code link file'. 

During this project I learned:
* To use features in Earsketch.
* Create a basic composition using Python.
* To create functions and variables with Python.
